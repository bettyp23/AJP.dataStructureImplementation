# Assignment 8 – Data Structures in Java

**Name:** Betty Phipps
**Description:** Demonstrates custom implementations of LinkedList, Stack, Queue, and BST.

## Overview

This project implements four fundamental data structures in Java:
- **MyLinkedList**: A singly linked list with add, remove, and display operations
- **MyStack**: A stack implementation with push, pop, peek, and isEmpty operations
- **MyQueue**: A queue implementation with enqueue, dequeue, peek, and isEmpty operations
- **BinarySearchTree**: A binary search tree with insert, contains, and in-order traversal operations

## Compile & Run

To compile all Java files:
```bash
javac *.java
```

To run the demonstration:
```bash
java DataStructureDemo
```

## Files Included

- `MyLinkedList.java` - Custom singly linked list implementation
- `MyStack.java` - Custom stack implementation
- `MyQueue.java` - Custom queue implementation
- `BinarySearchTree.java` - Custom binary search tree implementation
- `DataStructureDemo.java` - Main application demonstrating all data structures

## Expected Output

The program will demonstrate:
1. Linked List operations (add, remove, display)
2. Stack operations (push, pop, peek)
3. Queue operations (enqueue, dequeue, peek)
4. Binary Search Tree operations (insert, contains, in-order traversal)
